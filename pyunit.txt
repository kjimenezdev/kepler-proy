# PyUnit

### Purpose
Unit testing is useful to idenfity bugs in early development stage of the application when bugs are less recurrent and less expensive to fix

* Unit Test: Stripted code leve test designed to verify a small functionality or unit

## Test-Driven Development TDD:
First design Python Unit tests and only then carry on writing the code


## Stubs and Mocks
Stub: fill some dependency required for unit test to run correctly
Mock: a fake object which run tests where they assert

## Python Unit Testing Framework
* PyUnit: fixtures, test cases, test suites and test runner for the automated testing of the code

* Nose: Output capture, code coverage doctests

* Doctest: Allows to test code by running samples and verifying that they return the expected results

## PyUnit
Key classes:
* TestCase
* TestSuite
* TestLoader
* TextTestRunner
* TestResults
