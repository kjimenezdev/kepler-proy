# Docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class or method definition.

## Two types of Docstrings
1. String literals occuring after a simple assignment at the top level of a module, class or __init__method : "attribute dostrings"
2. String literals immediately after another docstring: "additional docstrings"

* Always use """ triple double quotes""
* Use r"""raw tripple double quotes"" if using backslashes in docstrings
* For Unicode docstrings use u"""Unicode triple-quoted strings"""

### One-line Docstrings
Should really fit one line.

* Tripple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line cause it makes it easier to later expand it
* The closing quotes are on the same line as the opening quotes
* Theres no blank space before or after the docstring
* The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. Is t[preescribes the function or methos's effect as a command
---> "Do this, return that.
* Should not be a signature iterating the function/method parameters


### Multi-line Docstrings
Consists on a summary line just like a one-line docstring followed by a blank line
that contains more elaborate description
